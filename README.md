Ronen course
First Assignment we implemented q-learn policy approximation algorithm on Taxi env from gym.
Second Assignment we used tile method to featurize the state space, with Q-learning for policy approximation.
Third Assignment was used an actor critic implementation, using gradient method with gaussian distribution for the policy function 
and using linear state_action value approximation (using TD(0) to update weights). 

In both the second and third assignments we used the mountain-car environment,
for the second assignment the non-continuous version, and for the third the continuous one.
